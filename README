Plants play an essential role in climate change, agriculture industry and a country's economy. Thereby taking care of plants is very crucial. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for plant leaf disease detection using techniques of Deep Learning is proposed. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected from “Plant Village Dataset”, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases. First of all, augmentation is applied on dataset to increase the sample size. Later Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is used with multiple convolution and pooling layers. The trained model achieves an accuracy of 96.05% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. When testing the model on a set of images collected from trusted online sources - i.e. taken under conditions different from the images used for training - the model achieves an accuracy of 96.1%.
